# Dataset_Analysis_Projects
You will find in this repository some of my works on Datasets found on Kaggle and other sources. My goal is train myself processing Data Analysis on large Datasets, and discover interesting patterns. 

Each Dataset Analysis is focused on testing a skill that I have learned through online courses developing such as Data Cleaning, Using Dataframes or Data visualisation for example.
