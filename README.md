# dataset_analysis_projects
You will find in this repository some of my works on Datasets downloaded from Kaggle and other sources. This repo is aimed to publish the projects I realized in the course of my training to process Data Analysis on large Datasets with Python.

Each project is focused on testing a skill that I have learned through online courses such as Data Cleaning, Using Dataframes or Data visualisation for example.
